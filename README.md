# xNode Graph AI
* A visual Behaviour Tree created to build a customizable AI for Unity.

__I will soon provide a game demo, it will be available here on GitHub to play in WebGL.__

Is an AI project designed for games in the Unity Engine. Its main purpose is to create a graphical representation of a Behavior Tree using the 'xNode' asset. This tool allows developers to quickly build AI systems by visually creating a tree-like structure of states. With xNode Graph AI, developers can easily create and customize logical structures and behaviors, enabling them to recompose scripts to create a wide variety of distinct AI behaviors.

The system is based on Behavior Trees, which provide a modular and customizable approach to AI design. By leveraging the power of xNode, developers can efficiently design and implement complex AI behaviors without the need for extensive coding. The visual nature of the tool enhances productivity and promotes rapid iteration, as developers can easily manipulate and rearrange nodes to create new AI behaviors.

xNode Graph AI empowers developers with a flexible and intuitive AI creation workflow, enabling them to craft sophisticated AI systems that suit the unique requirements of their games. Whether it's designing intelligent enemy behaviors, creating realistic NPC interactions, or implementing dynamic decision-making systems, xNode Graph AI offers a powerful solution for AI development in Unity games.

This asset is under development, so it may undergo changes at any time, for bug fixes and performance improvements, fortunately it is fully functional.

Initialy this project was created for 2D games but you can use it in 3D games, the only thing you will need is create custom nodes to create actions for your characters 3D, I recomend you to follow the documentation.
